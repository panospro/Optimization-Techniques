# ðŸ“ˆ Optimization Techniques

A collection of mathematical programming and numerical optimization projects implemented in MATLAB.

This repository includes various algorithms and exercises developed across multiple coursework projects, showcasing methods like:

- ðŸŸ¦ **Bisection Method**
- ðŸŸ¨ **Golden Section Search**
- ðŸŸ§ **Fibonacci Search**
- ðŸ“‰ **Gradient-Based Optimization (e.g., Steepest Descent)**
- ðŸ”— **Network Optimization and Projections**

Each project contains:
- Modular implementations of algorithms
- Visualizations (where applicable)
- Structured breakdown into tasks or sub-methods
